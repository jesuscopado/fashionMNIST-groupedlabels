# Fashion MNIST - Grouped labels

This project aims to build a multi-class fashion classifier using the FashionMNIST dataset. The classifier categorizes items into five different classes: Upper part, Bottom part, One piece, Footwear, and Bags.

## Features
- Multi-class classification using MobileNetV3 small architecture.
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Metrics evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- CI/CD Pipeline Plan and SQL Query optimization discussed in separate documentation (`docs/`).
